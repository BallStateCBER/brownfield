not levy the special tax for new bonds or lease obligations in the
annexed or included area unless the legislative body of the
municipality adopts an ordinance approving the levy.

in the area by regulatory processes or the ordinary operations of
private enterprise without resort to this chapter;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the public health and welfare will be benefited by:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the acquisition and redevelopment of the area under this
chapter as a redevelopment project area; or<br>

enlarges the boundaries of the area, the existing area does
not generate sufficient revenue to meet the financial
obligations of the original project;<br>
the commission shall cause to be prepared the data described in
subsection (b).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) After making a finding under subsection (a), the commission
shall cause to be prepared:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) maps and plats showing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the boundaries of the area in which property would be
acquired for, or otherwise affected by, the establishment of
a redevelopment project area or the amendment of the
resolution or plan for an existing area;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the location of the various parcels of property, streets,
alleys, and other features affecting the acquisition, clearance,
remediation, replatting, replanning, rezoning, or
redevelopment of the area, indicating any parcels of property
to be excluded from the acquisition or otherwise excluded
from the effects of the establishment of the redevelopment
project area or the amendment of the resolution or plan for
an existing area; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) the parts of the area acquired, if any, that are to be
devoted to public ways, levees, sewerage, parks,
playgrounds, and other public purposes under the
redevelopment plan;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) lists of the owners of the various parcels of property

<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) an estimate of the costs, if any, to be incurred for the
acquisition and redevelopment of property.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) This subsection applies to the initial establishment of a
redevelopment project area. After completion of the data required by
subsection (b), the redevelopment commission shall adopt a
resolution declaring that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the area needing redevelopment is a menace to the social
and economic interest of the unit and its inhabitants;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) it will be of public utility and benefit to acquire the area and
redevelop it under this chapter; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the area is designated as a redevelopment project area for
purposes of this chapter.<br>
The resolution must state the general boundaries of the
redevelopment project area, and that the department of
redevelopment proposes to acquire all of the interests in the land
within the boundaries, with certain designated exceptions, if there are
any.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) This subsection applies to the amendment of the resolution or
plan for an existing redevelopment project area. After completion of
the data required by subsection (b), the redevelopment commission
shall adopt a resolution declaring that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) except as provided by subsection (f), if the amendment
enlarges the boundaries of the area, the existing area does not
generate sufficient revenue to meet the financial obligations of
the original project;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) it will be of public utility and benefit to amend the
resolution or plan for the area; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) any additional area to be acquired under the amendment is
designated as part of the existing redevelopment project area for
purposes of this chapter.<br>
The resolution must state the general boundaries of the
redevelopment project area, including any changes made to those
boundaries by the amendment, and describe the activities that the
department of redevelopment is permitted to take under the
amendment, with any designated exceptions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) For the purpose of adopting a resolution under subsection (c)
or (d), it is sufficient to describe the boundaries of the redevelopment
project area by its location in relation to public ways or streams, or
otherwise, as determined by the commissioners. Property excepted
from the application of a resolution may be described by street
numbers or location.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The redevelopment commission is not required to make the
finding and declaration described in subsections (a)(4)(C) and (d)(1)
concerning the enlargement of the boundaries of an existing
redevelopment project area if, before the adoption of the resolution
under subsection (d), the Indiana economic development corporation
issues a finding approving the enlargement of the boundaries. Before
issuing a finding under this subsection, the Indiana economic
development corporation must consider whether the enlargement of
the boundaries will:
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) lead to increased investment in Indiana;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) foster job creation or job retention in Indiana;<br>

redevelopment project area is located; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) otherwise benefit the people of Indiana by increasing
opportunities for employment in Indiana and strengthening the
economy of Indiana.<br>

<b> Redevelopment project areas in certain counties; inclusion of
additional areas outside boundaries<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 15.5. (a) This section applies to a county having a population
of more than two hundred thousand (200,000) but less than three
hundred thousand (300,000).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In adopting a declaratory resolution under section 15 of this
chapter, a redevelopment commission may include a provision
stating that the redevelopment project area is considered to include
one (1) or more additional areas outside the boundaries of the
redevelopment project area if the redevelopment commission makes
the following findings and the requirements of subsection (c) are
met:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) One (1) or more taxpayers presently located within the
boundaries of the redevelopment project area are expected
within one (1) year to relocate all or part of their operations
outside the boundaries of the redevelopment project area and
have expressed an interest in relocating all or part of their
operations within the boundaries of an additional area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The relocation described in subdivision (1) will contribute
to the continuation of the conditions described in IC&nbsp;36-7-1-3 in
the redevelopment project area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For purposes of this section, it will be of public utility and
benefit to include the additional areas as part of the
redevelopment project area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Each additional area must be designated by the redevelopment
commission as a redevelopment project area or an economic
development area under this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Notwithstanding section 3 of this chapter, the additional areas
shall be considered to be a part of the redevelopment special taxing
district under the jurisdiction of the redevelopment commission. Any
excess property taxes that the commission has determined may be
paid to taxing units under section 39(b)(3) of this chapter shall be
paid to the taxing units from which the excess property taxes were
derived. All powers of the redevelopment commission authorized
under this chapter may be exercised by the redevelopment
commission in additional areas under its jurisdiction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The declaratory resolution must include a statement of the
general boundaries of each additional area. However, it is sufficient
<p>
to describe those boundaries by location in relation to public ways,
streams, or otherwise, as determined by the commissioners.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The declaratory resolution may include a provision with
respect to the allocation and distribution of property taxes with
respect to one (1) or more of the additional areas in the manner
provided in section 39 of this chapter. If the redevelopment
commission includes such a provision in the resolution, allocation
areas in the redevelopment project area and in the additional areas
considered to be part of the redevelopment project area shall be
considered a single allocation area for purposes of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) The additional areas must be located within the same county
as the redevelopment project area but are not otherwise required to
be within the jurisdiction of the redevelopment commission, if the
redevelopment commission obtains the consent by ordinance of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the county legislative body, for each additional area located
within the unincorporated part of the county; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the legislative body of the city or town affected, for each
additional area located within a city or town.<br>
In granting its consent, the legislative body shall approve the plan of
development or redevelopment relating to the additional area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) A declaratory resolution previously adopted may be amended
to include a provision to include additional areas as set forth in this
section and an allocation provision under section 39 of this chapter
with respect to one (1) or more of the additional areas in accordance
with sections 15, 16, and 17 of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The redevelopment commission may amend the allocation
provision of a declaratory resolution in accordance with sections 15,
16, and 17 of this chapter to change the assessment date that
determines the base assessed value of property in the allocation area
to any assessment date following the effective date of the allocation
provision of the declaratory resolution. Such a change may relate to
the assessment date that determines the base assessed value of that
portion of the allocation area that is located in the redevelopment
project area alone, that portion of the allocation area that is located
in an additional area alone, or the entire allocation area.<br>

<b> Acquisition of real property; procedure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 19. (a) If no appeal is taken or if an appeal is taken but is
unsuccessful, the redevelopment commission shall proceed with the
proposed project to the extent that money is available for that
purpose.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The redevelopment commission shall first approve and adopt
a list of the real property and interests in real property to be acquired
and the price to be offered to the owner of each parcel of interest.
The prices to be offered may not exceed the average of two (2)
independent appraisals of fair market value procured by the
commission except that appraisals are not required in transactions
with other governmental agencies. However, if the real property is
less than five (5) acres in size and the fair market value of the real
property or interest has been appraised by one (1) independent
appraiser at less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the second
appraisal may be made by a qualified employee of the department of
redevelopment. The prices indicated on the list may not be exceeded
unless specifically authorized by the commission or ordered by a
court in condemnation proceedings. The commission may except
from acquisition any real property in the area if the commission finds
that such an acquisition is not necessary under the redevelopment
plan. Appraisals made under this section are for the information of
the commission and are not open for public inspection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Negotiations for the purchase of property may be carried on
directly by the redevelopment commission, by its employees, or by
expert negotiations, but no option, contract, or understanding relative
to the purchase of real property is binding on the commission until
approved and accepted by the commission in writing. The
<p>
commission may authorize the payment of a nominal fee to bind an
option and as a part of the consideration for conveyance may agree
to pay the expense incident to the conveyance and determination of
the title of the property. Payment for the property purchased shall be
made when and as directed by the commission but only on delivery
of proper instruments conveying the title or interest of the owner to
the &quot;City (Town or County) of ______________ for the use and
benefit of its department of redevelopment&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) All real property and interests in real property acquired by the
redevelopment commission are free and clear of all liens,
assessments, and other governmental charges except for current
property taxes, which shall be prorated to the date of acquisition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (d), the
redevelopment commission may, before the time referred to in this
section, accept gifts of property needed for the redevelopment of
redevelopment project areas if the property is free and clear of all
liens other than taxes, assessments, and other governmental charges.
The commission may, before the time referred to in this section, take
options on or contract for the acquisition of property needed for the
redevelopment of redevelopment project areas if the options and
contracts are not binding on the commission or the district until the
time referred to in this section and until money is available to pay the
consideration set out in the options or contracts.<br>

property in a redevelopment project area by the exercise of the power
of eminent domain, the commission shall adopt a resolution setting
out its determination to exercise that power and directing its attorney
to file a petition in the name of the unit on behalf of the department
of redevelopment, in the circuit or superior court of the county in
which the property is situated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Eminent domain proceedings under this section are governed
by IC&nbsp;32-24 and other applicable statutory provisions for the exercise
of the power of eminent domain. Property already devoted to a public
use may be acquired under this section, but property belonging to the
state or any political subdivision may not be acquired without its
consent.<br>

<b> Commission authority in redevelopment area<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 21. (a) The redevelopment commission may proceed with the
clearing and replanning of the area described in the resolution before
the acquisition of all of that area. It may also proceed with the repair
and maintenance of buildings that have been acquired and are not to
be cleared, and with the following with respect to environmental
contamination:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Investigation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Remediation.<br>
The redevelopment commission may carry out activities under this
subsection by labor employed directly by the commission or by
contract. Contracts for clearance may provide that the contractor is
entitled to retain and dispose of salvaged material, as a part of the
contract price or on the basis of stated prices for the amounts of the
various materials actually salvaged.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) All contracts for material or labor under this section shall be
let under IC&nbsp;36-1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In the planning and rezoning of the real property acquired, the
opening, closing, relocation, and improvement of public ways, and
the construction, relocation, and improvement of levees, sewers,
parking facilities, and utility services, the redevelopment commission
shall proceed in the same manner as private owners of the property.
It may negotiate with the proper officers and agencies of the unit to
secure the proper orders, approvals, and consents.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Any construction work required in connection with
improvements in the area described in the resolution may be carried
out by:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the appropriate municipal or county department or agency;
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the department of redevelopment, if:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) all plans, specifications, and drawings are approved by
the appropriate department or agency; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the statutory procedures for the letting of contracts by
the appropriate department or agency are followed by the
department of redevelopment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The redevelopment commission may pay any charges or
assessments made on account of orders, approval, consents, and
construction work under this section, or may agree to pay these
assessments in installments as provided by statute in the case of
private owners. The commission may:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) by special waiver filed with the municipal works board or
county executive, waive the statutory procedure and notices
required by law in order to create valid liens on private
property; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) cause any assessments to be spread on a different basis than
that provided by statute.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) None of the real property acquired under this chapter may be
set aside and dedicated for public ways, parking facilities, sewers,
levees, parks, or other public purposes until the redevelopment
<p>
commission has obtained the consent and approval of the department
or agency under whose jurisdiction the property will be placed.<br>

<b> Public sale or lease of real property; procedure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 22. (a) This section does not apply to the sale or grant of real
property or interests in real property to urban enterprise associations
or community development corporations under section 22.2 of this
chapter. The provisions of this section concerning publication and
bidding procedures do not apply to sales, leases, or other dispositions
of real property to other public agencies for public purposes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Before offering for sale or lease to the public any of the real
property acquired, the redevelopment commission shall cause two (2)
separate appraisals of the sale value, or rental value in case of a
lease, to be made by independent appraisers. However, if the real
property is less than five (5) acres in size and the fair market value
of the real property or interest has been appraised by one (1)
independent appraiser at less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the
second appraisal may be made by a qualified employee of the
department of redevelopment. In making appraisals, the appraisers
shall take into consideration the size, location, and physical condition
of the parcels, the advantages accruing to the parcels under the
redevelopment plan, and all other factors having a bearing on the
value of the parcels. The appraisals are solely for the information of
the commission, and are not open for public inspection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The redevelopment commission shall then prepare an offering
sheet showing the parcels to be offered and the offering prices, which
may not be less than the average of the two (2) appraisals. Copies of
the offering sheets shall be furnished to prospective buyers on
request. Maps and plats showing the size and location of all parcels
to be offered shall also be kept available for inspection at the office
of the department.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) A notice shall be published in accordance with IC&nbsp;5-3-1. The
notice must state that at a designated time the commission will open
and consider written offers for the purchase or lease of the real
property being offered. In giving the notice it is not necessary to
describe each parcel separately, or to specify the exact terms of
disposition, but the notice:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) must state the general location of the parcels;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) call attention generally to any limitations on the use to be
made of the real property offered; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) state that a bid submitted by a trust (as defined in
IC&nbsp;30-4-1-1(a)) must identify each:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) beneficiary of the trust; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) settlor empowered to revoke or modify the trust.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) At the time fixed in the notice the commission shall open and
consider any offers received. These offers may consist of
consideration in the form of cash, other property, or a combination
<p>
of cash and other property. However, with respect to property other
than cash, the offer must be accompanied by evidence of the
property's fair market value that is satisfactory to the commission in
its sole discretion. All offers received shall be opened at public
meetings of the commission and shall be kept open for public
inspection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The commission may reject any bids and may make awards to
the highest and best bidders. In determining the best bids, the
commission shall take into consideration the following factors:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The size and character of the improvements proposed to be
made by the bidder on the real property bid on.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The bidder's plans and ability to improve the real property
with reasonable promptness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Whether the real property when improved will be sold or
rented.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The bidder's proposed sale or rental prices.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The bidder's compliance with subsection (d)(3).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Any factors that will assure the commission that the sale or
lease, if made, will further the execution of the redevelopment
plan and best serve the interest of the community, from the
standpoint of both human and economic welfare.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) The commission may contract with a bidder in regard to the
factors listed in subsection (f), and the contract may provide for the
deposit of surety bonds, the making of good faith deposits, liquidated
damages, the right of repurchase, or other rights and remedies if the
bidder fails to comply with the contract.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) After the opening and consideration of the written offers filed
in response to the notice, the commission may dispose of the
remainder of the available real property either at public sale or by
private negotiation carried on by the commission, its regular
employees, or real estate experts employed for that purpose. For a
period of thirty (30) days after the opening of the written offers, no
sale or lease may be made at a price or rental less than that shown on
the offering sheet, except in the case of sales or rentals of ten (10) or
more parcels to a purchaser or lessee who agrees to improve the
parcels immediately, but after that period the commission may adjust
the offering prices in the manner the commission considers necessary
to further the redevelopment plan.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A conveyance under this section may not be made until the
agreed consideration has been paid, unless the redevelopment
commission passes a resolution expressly providing that the
consideration does not have to be paid before the conveyance is
made. In addition, such a resolution may provide for a mortgage or
other security. All deeds, leases, land sale contracts, or other
conveyances, and all contracts and agreements, including contracts
of purchase and sale and contracts for advancements, loans, grants,
contributions, or other aid, shall be executed in the name of the &quot;City
(or Town or County) of ______________, Department of
Redevelopment&quot;, and shall be signed by the president or vice
president of the redevelopment commission and attested by its
<p>
secretary. A seal is not required on these instruments or any other
instruments executed in the name of the department.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The commission may sell or grant, at no cost, title to real
property to a community development corporation (as defined in
IC&nbsp;4-4-28-2) for the purpose of providing low or moderate income
housing or other development that will benefit or serve low or
moderate income families if the following requirements are met:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The community development corporation has as a major
corporate purpose and function the provision of housing for low
and moderate income families within the geographic area in
which the parcel of real property is located.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The community development corporation agrees to cause

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The community development corporation agrees to
rehabilitate or otherwise develop the property in a manner that
is similar to and consistent with the use of the other properties

secure from the county under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-25-9(e) parcels of property
acquired by the county under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-24 and IC&nbsp;6-1.1-25.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Before offering any parcel of property for sale or grant, the
fair market value of the parcel of property must be determined by an
appraiser, who may be an employee of the department. However, if

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 22.6. (a) As used in this section, &quot;abutting landowner&quot; means
an owner of property that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) touches, borders on, or is contiguous to the property that is
the subject of sale; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) does not constitute a:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) public easement; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) public right-of-way.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As used in this section, &quot;offering price&quot; means the appraised
value of real property plus all costs associated with the sale,
including:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) appraisal fees;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) title insurance;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) recording fees; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) advertising costs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If the assessed value of a tract of real property to be sold is
less than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), based on the most recent
assessment of the tract or of the tract of which it was a part before it
was acquired, the commission may proceed under this section.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The commission may determine that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the highest and best use of the tract is sale to an abutting
landowner;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the cost to the public of maintaining the tract equals or
exceeds the estimated fair market value of the tract; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) it is economically unjustifiable to sell the tract under section
22 of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Not more than ten (10) days after the commission makes a
determination under subsection (d), the commission shall publish a
notice in accordance with IC&nbsp;5-3-1 identifying the tracts intended for
sale by legal description and, if possible, by key number and street
address. The notice must also include the offering price and a
statement that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the property may not be sold to a person who is ineligible
under IC&nbsp;36-1-11-16; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) an offer to purchase the property submitted by a trust (as

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The commission shall also have each tract appraised. The
appraiser must be a person who is professionally engaged in making
appraisals, a person licensed under IC&nbsp;25-34.1, or an employee of the
political subdivision who is familiar with the value of the tract.
However, if the assessed value of a tract is less than six thousand
dollars ($6,000), based on the most recent assessment of the tract or
of the tract of which it was a part before it was acquired, the
commission is not required to have the tract appraised.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) If, not more than ten (10) days after the date of publication of
the notice under subsection (e), the commission receives one (1) or
more eligible offers to purchase a tract listed in the notice at or in
excess of the offering price, the commission shall conduct the
negotiation and sale of the tract under section 22(f), 22(g), and 22(i)
of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Notwithstanding subsection (g), if not more than ten (10) days
after the date of publication of the notice under subsection (e) the
commission does not receive from any person other than an abutting
landowner an eligible offer to purchase the tract at or in excess of the
offering price, the commission shall conduct the negotiation and sale
of the tract as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If only one (1) eligible abutting landowner makes an eligible
offer to purchase the tract, then subject to IC&nbsp;36-1-11-16 and
without further appraisal or notice, the commission shall offer
to negotiate for the sale of the tract with that abutting
landowner.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If more than one (1) eligible abutting landowner submits an
eligible offer to purchase the tract, the tract shall be sold to the
eligible abutting landowner who submits the highest eligible
offer for the tract and who complies with any requirement under
subsection (e)(2).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If no eligible abutting landowner submits an eligible offer
to purchase the tract, the commission may sell the tract to any
person who submits the highest eligible offer for the tract,
except a person who is ineligible to purchase the tract under
IC&nbsp;36-1-11-16.<br>

Sec. 25.1. (a) In addition to other methods of raising money for
property acquisition or redevelopment in a redevelopment project
area, and in anticipation of the special tax to be levied under section
27 of this chapter, the taxes allocated under section 39 of this
chapter, or other revenues of the district, or any combination of these
sources, the redevelopment commission may, by resolution and
subject to subsection (p), issue the bonds of the special taxing district
in the name of the unit. The amount of the bonds may not exceed the
total, as estimated by the commission, of all expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with the acquisition and redevelopment of the
property, including:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the total cost of all land, rights-of-way, and other property
to be acquired and redeveloped;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) all reasonable and necessary architectural, engineering,
legal, financing, accounting, advertising, bond discount, and
supervisory expenses related to the acquisition and
redevelopment of the property or the issuance of bonds;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) capitalized interest permitted by this chapter and a debt
service reserve for the bonds to the extent the redevelopment
commission determines that a reserve is reasonably required;
and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) expenses that the redevelopment commission is required or
permitted to pay under IC&nbsp;8-23-17.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) If the redevelopment commission plans to acquire different
parcels of land or let different contracts for redevelopment work at
approximately the same time, whether under one (1) or more
resolutions, the commission may provide for the total cost in one (1)
issue of bonds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The bonds must be dated as set forth in the bond resolution
and negotiable, subject to the requirements of the bond resolution for
registering the bonds. The resolution authorizing the bonds must
state:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the denominations of the bonds;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the place or places at which the bonds are payable; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the term of the bonds, which may not exceed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) fifty (50) years, for bonds issued before July 1, 2008;<br>

defined in IC&nbsp;6-3.1-29-6); or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) property used in the operation or maintenance of an
integrated coal gasification powerplant (as defined in
IC&nbsp;6-3.1-29-6);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that received a certificate of public convenience and
necessity from the Indiana utility regulatory commission
under IC&nbsp;8-1-8.5 et seq. before July 1, 2008; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) twenty-five (25) years, for bonds issued after June 30,
2008, that are not described in clause (B).<br>
The resolution may also state that the bonds are redeemable before
maturity with or without a premium, as determined by the
redevelopment commission.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The redevelopment commission shall certify a copy of the
resolution authorizing the bonds to the municipal or county fiscal
officer, who shall then prepare the bonds, subject to subsection (p).
The seal of the unit must be impressed on the bonds, or a facsimile

unit and attested by the municipal or county fiscal officer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The bonds are exempt from taxation for all purposes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) The municipal or county fiscal officer shall give notice of the
sale of the bonds by publication in accordance with IC&nbsp;5-3-1. The
municipal fiscal officer, or county fiscal officer or executive, shall
sell the bonds to the highest bidder, but may not sell them for less
than ninety-seven percent (97%) of their par value. However, bonds
payable solely or in part from tax proceeds allocated under section
39(b)(2) of this chapter, or other revenues of the district may be sold
at a private negotiated sale.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Except as provided in subsection (i), a redevelopment
commission may not issue the bonds when the total issue, including
bonds already issued and to be issued, exceeds two percent (2%) of
the adjusted value of the taxable property in the special taxing
district, as determined under IC&nbsp;36-1-15.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The bonds are not a corporate obligation of the unit but are an
indebtedness of the taxing district. The bonds and interest are
payable, as set forth in the bond resolution of the redevelopment
commission:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) from a special tax levied upon all of the property in the
taxing district, as provided by section 27 of this chapter;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) from the tax proceeds allocated under section 39(b)(2) of
this chapter;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) from other revenues available to the redevelopment
commission; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) from a combination of the methods stated in subdivisions (1)
through (3).<br>
If the bonds are payable solely from the tax proceeds allocated under
<p>
section 39(b)(2) of this chapter, other revenues of the redevelopment
commission, or any combination of these sources, they may be issued
in any amount without limitation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) Proceeds from the sale of bonds may be used to pay the cost of
interest on the bonds for a period not to exceed five (5) years from
the date of issuance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) All laws relating to the giving of notice of the issuance of
bonds, the giving of notice of a hearing on the appropriation of the
proceeds of the bonds, the right of taxpayers to appear and be heard
on the proposed appropriation, and the approval of the appropriation
by the department of local government finance apply to all bonds
issued under this chapter that are payable from the special benefits
tax levied pursuant to section 27 of this chapter or from taxes
allocated under section 39 of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l) All laws relating to:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the filing of petitions requesting the issuance of bonds; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the right of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) taxpayers and voters to remonstrate against the issuance
of bonds in the case of a proposed bond issue described by
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-20-3.1(a); or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) voters to vote on the issuance of bonds in the case of a
proposed bond issue described by IC&nbsp;6-1.1-20-3.5(a);<br>
apply to bonds issued under this chapter except for bonds payable
solely from tax proceeds allocated under section 39(b)(2) of this
chapter, other revenues of the redevelopment commission, or any
combination of these sources.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m) If a debt service reserve is created from the proceeds of
bonds, the debt service reserve may be used to pay principal and
interest on the bonds as provided in the bond resolution.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n) Any amount remaining in the debt service reserve after all of
the bonds of the issue for which the debt service reserve was
established have matured shall be:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) deposited in the allocation fund established under section
39(b)(2) of this chapter; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to the extent permitted by law, transferred to the county or
municipality that established the department of redevelopment
for use in reducing the county's or municipality's property tax
levies for debt service.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(o) If bonds are issued under this chapter that are payable solely
or in part from revenues to the redevelopment commission from a
project or projects, the redevelopment commission may adopt a
resolution or trust indenture or enter into covenants as is customary
in the issuance of revenue bonds. The resolution or trust indenture
may pledge or assign the revenues from the project or projects, but
may not convey or mortgage any project or parts of a project. The
resolution or trust indenture may also contain any provisions for
protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bond owners
as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law,
including covenants setting forth the duties of the redevelopment
commission. The redevelopment commission may establish fees and
<p>
charges for the use of any project and covenant with the owners of
any bonds to set those fees and charges at a rate sufficient to protect
the interest of the owners of the bonds. Any revenue bonds issued by
the redevelopment commission that are payable solely from revenues
of the commission shall contain a statement to that effect in the form
of bond.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(p) If the total principal amount of bonds authorized by a
resolution of the redevelopment commission adopted before July 1,
2008, is equal to or greater than three million dollars ($3,000,000),
the bonds may not be issued without the approval, by resolution, of
the legislative body of the unit. Bonds authorized in any principal
amount by a resolution of the redevelopment commission adopted
after June 30, 2008, may not be issued without the approval of the
legislative body of the unit.<br>

<b> Leased facilities; procedure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 25.2. (a) A redevelopment commission may enter into a lease
of any property that could be financed with the proceeds of bonds
issued under this chapter with a lessor for a term not to exceed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) fifty (50) years, for a lease entered into before July 1, 2008;
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) twenty-five (25) years, for a lease entered into after June 30,
2008.<br>
The lease may provide for payments to be made by the
redevelopment commission from special benefits taxes levied under
section 27 of this chapter, taxes allocated under section 39 of this
chapter, any other revenues available to the redevelopment
commission, or any combination of these sources.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A lease may provide that payments by the redevelopment
commission to the lessor are required only to the extent and only for
the period that the lessor is able to provide the leased facilities in
accordance with the lease. The terms of each lease must be based
upon the value of the facilities leased and may not create a debt of
the unit or the district for purposes of the Constitution of the State of
Indiana.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A lease may be entered into by the redevelopment commission
only after a public hearing by the redevelopment commission at
which all interested parties are provided the opportunity to be heard.
After the public hearing, the redevelopment commission may adopt
a resolution authorizing the execution of the lease on behalf of the
unit if it finds that the service to be provided throughout the term of
the lease will serve the public purpose of the unit and is in the best
interests of its residents. Any lease approved by a resolution of the
redevelopment commission must be approved by an ordinance of the
<p>
fiscal body of the unit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Upon execution of a lease providing for payments by the
redevelopment commission in whole or in part from the levy of
special benefits taxes under section 27 of this chapter and upon
approval of the lease by the unit's fiscal body, the redevelopment
commission shall publish notice of the execution of the lease and its
approval in accordance with IC&nbsp;5-3-1. Fifty (50) or more taxpayers
residing in the redevelopment district who will be affected by the
lease and who may be of the opinion that no necessity exists for the
execution of the lease or that the payments provided for in the lease
are not fair and reasonable may file a petition in the office of the
county auditor within thirty (30) days after the publication of the
notice of execution and approval. The petition must set forth the
petitioners' names, addresses, and objections to the lease and the
facts showing that the execution of the lease is unnecessary or
unwise or that the payments provided for in the lease are not fair and
reasonable, as the case may be.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Upon the filing of the petition, the county auditor shall
immediately certify a copy of it, together with such other data as may
be necessary in order to present the questions involved, to the
department of local government finance. Upon receipt of the certified
petition and information, the department of local government finance
shall fix a time and place for a hearing in the redevelopment district,
which must be not less than five (5) or more than thirty (30) days
after the time is fixed. Notice of the hearing shall be given by the
department of local government finance to the members of the fiscal
body, to the redevelopment commission, and to the first fifty (50)
petitioners on the petition by a letter signed by the commissioner or
deputy commissioner of the department and enclosed with fully
prepaid postage sent to those persons at their usual place of
residence, at least five (5) days before the date of the hearing. The
decision of the department of local government finance on the
appeal, upon the necessity for the execution of the lease, and as to
whether the payments under it are fair and reasonable, is final.<br>

tax on all of the property of the redevelopment taxing district, in such
a manner as to meet and pay the principal of the bonds as they
mature, together with all accruing interest on the bonds or lease
rental payments under section 25.2 of this chapter. The commission
shall cause the tax levied to be certified to the proper officers as
other tax levies are certified, and to the auditor of the county in
which the redevelopment district is located, before the second day of
October in each year. The tax shall be estimated and entered on the

be applied to the payment of the bonds as they mature and the
interest on the bonds as it accrues, or to make lease payments and to
no other purpose. All accumulations of the fund before their use for
the payment of bonds and interest or to make lease payments shall be
deposited with the depository or depositories for other public funds
of the unit in accordance with IC&nbsp;5-13, unless they are invested under

<b> Tax anticipation warrants; authorization; procedure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 27.5. (a) The redevelopment commission may borrow money
in anticipation of receipt of the proceeds of taxes levied for the
redevelopment district bond fund and not yet collected, and may
evidence this borrowing by issuing warrants of the redevelopment
district. However, the aggregate principal amount of warrants issued
in anticipation of and payable from the same tax levy or levies may
not exceed an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of that tax levy
or levies, as certified by the department of local government finance,
or as determined by multiplying the rate of tax as finally approved by
the total assessed valuation (after deducting all mortgage deductions)
within the redevelopment district, as most recently certified by the
county auditor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The warrants may be authorized and issued at any time after
the tax or taxes in anticipation of which they are issued have been
levied by the redevelopment commission. For purposes of this
section, taxes for any year are considered to be levied upon adoption
by the commission of a resolution prescribing the tax levies for the
year. However, the warrants may not be delivered and paid for before
final approval of the tax levy or levies by the county board of tax
adjustment or, if appealed, by the department of local government
finance, unless the issuance of the warrants has been approved by the
department.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) All action that this section requires or authorizes the
redevelopment commission to take may be taken by resolution,
which need not be published or posted. The resolution takes effect
immediately upon its adoption by the redevelopment commission. An
action to contest the validity of tax anticipation warrants may not be
brought later than ten (10) days after the sale date.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) In their resolution authorizing the warrants, the redevelopment
<p>
commission must provide that the warrants mature at a time or times
not later than December 31 after the year in which the taxes in
anticipation of which the warrants are issued are due and payable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) In their resolution authorizing the warrants, the redevelopment
commission may provide:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the date of the warrants;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the interest rate of the warrants;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the time of interest payments on the warrants;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the denomination of the warrants;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) the form either registered or payable to bearer, of the
warrants;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) the place or places of payment of the warrants, either inside
or outside the state;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) the medium of payment of the warrants;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) the terms of redemption, if any, of the warrants, at a price
not exceeding par value and accrued interest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) the manner of execution of the warrants; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) that all costs incurred in connection with the issuance of
the warrants may be paid from the proceeds of the warrants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The warrants shall be sold for not less than par value, after
notice inviting bids has been published under IC&nbsp;5-3-1. The
redevelopment commission may also publish the notice in other
newspapers or financial journals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Warrants and the interest on them are not subject to any
limitation contained in section 25.1 of this chapter, and are payable
solely from the proceeds of the tax levy or levies in anticipation of
which the warrants were issued. The authorizing resolution must
pledge a sufficient amount of the proceeds of the tax levy or levies
to the payment of the warrants and the interest.<br>

<b> Neighborhood development programs; authorization; procedure;
<p>
federal aid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 36. (a) In addition to all of the other powers, authority, and
jurisdiction of a redevelopment commission operating under this
chapter, a commission may undertake a neighborhood development
program. A neighborhood development program may include one (1)
or more contiguous or noncontiguous areas needing redevelopment.
These areas may include redevelopment project areas or urban
renewal project areas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Whenever the redevelopment commission finds that any area
in the territory under their jurisdiction is an area needing
redevelopment to an extent that cannot be corrected by regulatory
processes or by the ordinary operations of private enterprise without
resort to the provisions of this chapter, and that the public health and
welfare would be benefited by the redevelopment or urban renewal
of that area under this chapter, the commission shall prepare a
description and map showing the boundaries of the area to be
included in the neighborhood development program.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) After preparation of the description and map under subsection
(b), the redevelopment commission shall adopt a resolution
declaring, confirming, and delineating the general boundaries of the
area and of the parts of that area that are to be designated as
redevelopment project areas or urban renewal areas. However, an
area may not be designated as a redevelopment project area or urban
renewal area unless the required appraisals, maps, plats and plans
have been prepared and all other requirements of this chapter are
met.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Areas designated as redevelopment project areas or urban
renewal areas under this section are considered to be redevelopment
project areas or urban renewal areas for all purposes of this chapter.
Areas within the neighborhood development program area that are
not so designated are not considered to be redevelopment project
areas or urban renewal areas until designated as such by an
amendment to the neighborhood development plan, adopted in the
same manner and with the same procedure as a declaratory and
confirmatory resolution declaring an area a redevelopment project
area or urban renewal area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The redevelopment commission may make studies, appraisals,
maps, plats, and plans of areas within the neighborhood development
program area that have not been designated as redevelopment project
areas or urban renewal project areas. However, the commission may
not acquire any land in those areas until the neighborhood
development plan has been amended to designate that land as a part
of an urban renewal or redevelopment project area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The redevelopment commission may amend the neighborhood
development plan, in the manner prescribed by subsection (d), to
include additional areas in the neighborhood development program
areas, either generally or as urban renewal or redevelopment project
areas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) The redevelopment commission may apply for and accept
advances, loans, grants, contributions, and any other forms of
<p>
financial assistance from the federal government, may contract with
the federal government for any costs arising from a neighborhood
development program, or may otherwise contract with the federal
government concerning a neighborhood development program, to the
same extent as they may for urban renewal project areas.<br>

<b> Distribution and allocation of taxes<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2010. See also
following version of this section, effective 1-1-2010.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sec. 39. (a) As used in this section:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Allocation area&quot; means that part of a redevelopment project area
to which an allocation provision of a declaratory resolution adopted
under section 15 of this chapter refers for purposes of distribution
and allocation of property taxes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Base assessed value&quot; means the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If an allocation provision is adopted after June 30, 1995, in
a declaratory resolution or an amendment to a declaratory
resolution establishing an economic development area:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the net assessed value of all the property as finally
determined for the assessment date immediately preceding
the effective date of the allocation provision of the
declaratory resolution, as adjusted under subsection (h); plus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) to the extent that it is not included in clause (A), the net
assessed value of property that is assessed as residential
property under the rules of the department of local
government finance, as finally determined for any
assessment date after the effective date of the allocation
provision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If an allocation provision is adopted after June 30, 1997, in
a declaratory resolution or an amendment to a declaratory
resolution establishing a redevelopment project area:
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the net assessed value of all the property as finally
determined for the assessment date immediately preceding
the effective date of the allocation provision of the
declaratory resolution, as adjusted under subsection (h); plus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) to the extent that it is not included in clause (A), the net
assessed value of property that is assessed as residential
property under the rules of the department of local
government finance, as finally determined for any
assessment date after the effective date of the allocation
provision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) an allocation provision adopted before June 30, 1995, in
a declaratory resolution or an amendment to a declaratory
resolution establishing a redevelopment project area expires
after June 30, 1997; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) after June 30, 1997, a new allocation provision is
included in an amendment to the declaratory resolution;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the net assessed value of all the property as finally determined
for the assessment date immediately preceding the effective
date of the allocation provision adopted after June 30, 1997, as
adjusted under subsection (h).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Except as provided in subdivision (5), for all other
allocation areas, the net assessed value of all the property as
finally determined for the assessment date immediately
preceding the effective date of the allocation provision of the
declaratory resolution, as adjusted under subsection (h).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If an allocation area established in an economic
development area before July 1, 1995, is expanded after June
30, 1995, the definition in subdivision (1) applies to the
expanded part of the area added after June 30, 1995.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) If an allocation area established in a redevelopment project
area before July 1, 1997, is expanded after June 30, 1997, the
definition in subdivision (2) applies to the expanded part of the
area added after June 30, 1997.<br>
Except as provided in section 39.3 of this chapter, &quot;property taxes&quot;
means taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on real property. However, upon
approval by a resolution of the redevelopment commission adopted
before June 1, 1987, &quot;property taxes&quot; also includes taxes imposed
under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on depreciable personal property. If a redevelopment
commission adopted before June 1, 1987, a resolution to include
within the definition of property taxes taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1
on depreciable personal property that has a useful life in excess of
eight (8) years, the commission may by resolution determine the
percentage of taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on all depreciable
personal property that will be included within the definition of
property taxes. However, the percentage included must not exceed
twenty-five percent (25%) of the taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on all
depreciable personal property.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A declaratory resolution adopted under section 15 of this
chapter on or before the allocation deadline determined under
<p>
subsection (i) may include a provision with respect to the allocation
and distribution of property taxes for the purposes and in the manner
provided in this section. A declaratory resolution previously adopted
may include an allocation provision by the amendment of that
declaratory resolution on or before the allocation deadline
determined under subsection (i) in accordance with the procedures
required for its original adoption. A declaratory resolution or an
amendment that establishes an allocation provision after June 30,
1995, must specify an expiration date for the allocation provision.
For an allocation area established before July 1, 2008, the expiration
date may not be more than thirty (30) years after the date on which
the allocation provision is established. For an allocation area
established after June 30, 2008, the expiration date may not be more
than twenty-five (25) years after the date on which the allocation
provision is established. However, with respect to bonds or other
obligations that were issued before July 1, 2008, if any of the bonds
or other obligations that were scheduled when issued to mature
before the specified expiration date and that are payable only from
allocated tax proceeds with respect to the allocation area remain
outstanding as of the expiration date, the allocation provision does
not expire until all of the bonds or other obligations are no longer
outstanding. The allocation provision may apply to all or part of the
redevelopment project area. The allocation provision must require
that any property taxes subsequently levied by or for the benefit of
any public body entitled to a distribution of property taxes on taxable
property in the allocation area be allocated and distributed as
follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the proceeds
of the taxes attributable to the lesser of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the assessed value of the property for the assessment
date with respect to which the allocation and distribution is
made; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the base assessed value;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be allocated to and, when collected, paid into the funds of
the respective taxing units.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, property tax
proceeds in excess of those described in subdivision (1) shall be
allocated to the redevelopment district and, when collected,
paid into an allocation fund for that allocation area that may be
used by the redevelopment district only to do one (1) or more of
the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Pay the principal of and interest on any obligations
payable solely from allocated tax proceeds which are
incurred by the redevelopment district for the purpose of
financing or refinancing the redevelopment of that allocation
area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Establish, augment, or restore the debt service reserve
for bonds payable solely or in part from allocated tax
proceeds in that allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Pay the principal of and interest on bonds payable from
<p>
allocated tax proceeds in that allocation area and from the
special tax levied under section 27 of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Pay the principal of and interest on bonds issued by the
unit to pay for local public improvements that are physically
located in or physically connected to that allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Pay premiums on the redemption before maturity of
bonds payable solely or in part from allocated tax proceeds
in that allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(F) Make payments on leases payable from allocated tax
proceeds in that allocation area under section 25.2 of this
chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G) Reimburse the unit for expenditures made by it for local
public improvements (which include buildings, parking
facilities, and other items described in section 25.1(a) of this
chapter) that are physically located in or physically
connected to that allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H) Reimburse the unit for rentals paid by it for a building or
parking facility that is physically located in or physically
connected to that allocation area under any lease entered into
under IC&nbsp;36-1-10.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I) For property taxes first due and payable before January
1, 2009, pay all or a part of a property tax replacement credit
to taxpayers in an allocation area as determined by the
redevelopment commission. This credit equals the amount
determined under the following STEPS for each taxpayer in
a taxing district (as defined in IC&nbsp;6-1.1-1-20) that contains
all or part of the allocation area:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP ONE: Determine that part of the sum of the amounts
under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(1)(A), IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(2),
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(3), IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(4), and
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(5) that is attributable to the taxing district.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP TWO: Divide:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that part of each county's eligible property tax
replacement amount (as defined in IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2) for that
year as determined under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-4 that is attributable
to the taxing district; by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the STEP ONE sum.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP THREE: Multiply:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the STEP TWO quotient; times<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the total amount of the taxpayer's taxes (as defined in
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2) levied in the taxing district that have been
allocated during that year to an allocation fund under this
section.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not all the taxpayers in an allocation area receive the credit
in full, each taxpayer in the allocation area is entitled to
receive the same proportion of the credit. A taxpayer may
not receive a credit under this section and a credit under
section 39.5 of this chapter (before its repeal) in the same
year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J) Pay expenses incurred by the redevelopment commission
<p>
for local public improvements that are in the allocation area
or serving the allocation area. Public improvements include
buildings, parking facilities, and other items described in
section 25.1(a) of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(K) Reimburse public and private entities for expenses
incurred in training employees of industrial facilities that are
located:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in the allocation area; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) on a parcel of real property that has been classified as
industrial property under the rules of the department of
local government finance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the total amount of money spent for this purpose
in any year may not exceed the total amount of money in the
allocation fund that is attributable to property taxes paid by
the industrial facilities described in this clause. The
reimbursements under this clause must be made within three
(3) years after the date on which the investments that are the
basis for the increment financing are made.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(L) Pay the costs of carrying out an eligible efficiency
project (as defined in IC&nbsp;36-9-41-1.5) within the unit that
established the redevelopment commission. However,
property tax proceeds may be used under this clause to pay
the costs of carrying out an eligible efficiency project only
if those property tax proceeds exceed the amount necessary
to do the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Make, when due, any payments required under clauses
(A) through (K), including any payments of principal and
interest on bonds and other obligations payable under this
subdivision, any payments of premiums under this

subdivision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Make any reimbursements required under this
subdivision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Pay any expenses required under this subdivision.<br>

under this subdivision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation fund may not be used for operating expenses of
the commission.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Except as provided in subsection (g), before July 15 of each
year the commission shall do the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Determine the amount, if any, by which the assessed
value of the taxable property in the allocation area for the
most recent assessment date minus the base assessed value,
when multiplied by the estimated tax rate of the allocation
area, will exceed the amount of assessed value needed to
produce the property taxes necessary to make, when due,
principal and interest payments on bonds described in
subdivision (2) plus the amount necessary for other purposes
described in subdivision (2).
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Provide a written notice to the county auditor, the fiscal
body of the county or municipality that established the
department of redevelopment, and the officers who are
authorized to fix budgets, tax rates, and tax levies under
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-17-5 for each of the other taxing units that is wholly
or partly located within the allocation area. The notice must:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) state the amount, if any, of excess assessed value that
the commission has determined may be allocated to the
respective taxing units in the manner prescribed in
subdivision (1); or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) state that the commission has determined that there is
no excess assessed value that may be allocated to the
respective taxing units in the manner prescribed in
subdivision (1).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The county auditor shall allocate to the respective taxing
units the amount, if any, of excess assessed value determined
by the commission. The commission may not authorize an
allocation of assessed value to the respective taxing units
under this subdivision if to do so would endanger the
interests of the holders of bonds described in subdivision (2)
or lessors under section 25.3 of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) For the purpose of allocating taxes levied by or for any taxing
unit or units, the assessed value of taxable property in a territory in
the allocation area that is annexed by any taxing unit after the
effective date of the allocation provision of the declaratory resolution
is the lesser of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the assessed value of the property for the assessment date
with respect to which the allocation and distribution is made; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the base assessed value.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Property tax proceeds allocable to the redevelopment district
under subsection (b)(2) may, subject to subsection (b)(3), be
irrevocably pledged by the redevelopment district for payment as set
forth in subsection (b)(2).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Notwithstanding any other law, each assessor shall, upon
petition of the redevelopment commission, reassess the taxable
property situated upon or in, or added to, the allocation area,
effective on the next assessment date after the petition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Notwithstanding any other law, the assessed value of all
taxable property in the allocation area, for purposes of tax limitation,
property tax replacement, and formulation of the budget, tax rate, and
tax levy for each political subdivision in which the property is
located is the lesser of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the assessed value of the property as valued without regard
to this section; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the base assessed value.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) If any part of the allocation area is located in an enterprise
zone created under IC&nbsp;5-28-15, the unit that designated the allocation
area shall create funds as specified in this subsection. A unit that has
obligations, bonds, or leases payable from allocated tax proceeds
under subsection (b)(2) shall establish an allocation fund for the
<p>
purposes specified in subsection (b)(2) and a special zone fund. Such
a unit shall, until the end of the enterprise zone phase out period,
deposit each year in the special zone fund any amount in the
allocation fund derived from property tax proceeds in excess of those
described in subsection (b)(1) from property located in the enterprise
zone that exceeds the amount sufficient for the purposes specified in
subsection (b)(2) for the year. The amount sufficient for purposes
specified in subsection (b)(2) for the year shall be determined based
on the pro rata portion of such current property tax proceeds from the
part of the enterprise zone that is within the allocation area as
compared to all such current property tax proceeds derived from the
allocation area. A unit that has no obligations, bonds, or leases
payable from allocated tax proceeds under subsection (b)(2) shall
establish a special zone fund and deposit all the property tax
proceeds in excess of those described in subsection (b)(1) in the fund
derived from property tax proceeds in excess of those described in
subsection (b)(1) from property located in the enterprise zone. The
unit that creates the special zone fund shall use the fund (based on
the recommendations of the urban enterprise association) for
programs in job training, job enrichment, and basic skill development
that are designed to benefit residents and employers in the enterprise
zone or other purposes specified in subsection (b)(2), except that
where reference is made in subsection (b)(2) to allocation area it
shall refer for purposes of payments from the special zone fund only
to that part of the allocation area that is also located in the enterprise
zone. Those programs shall reserve at least one-half (1/2) of their
enrollment in any session for residents of the enterprise zone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) The state board of accounts and department of local
government finance shall make the rules and prescribe the forms and
procedures that they consider expedient for the implementation of
this chapter. After each general reassessment under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-4, the
department of local government finance shall adjust the base
assessed value one (1) time to neutralize any effect of the general
reassessment on the property tax proceeds allocated to the
redevelopment district under this section. After each annual
adjustment under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-4-4.5, the department of local government
finance shall adjust the base assessed value one (1) time to neutralize
any effect of the annual adjustment on the property tax proceeds
allocated to the redevelopment district under this section. However,
the adjustments under this subsection may not include the effect of
property tax abatements under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-12.1, and these adjustments
may not produce less property tax proceeds allocable to the
redevelopment district under subsection (b)(2) than would otherwise
have been received if the general reassessment or annual adjustment
had not occurred. The department of local government finance may
prescribe procedures for county and township officials to follow to
assist the department in making the adjustments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The allocation deadline referred to in subsection (b) is
determined in the following manner:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The initial allocation deadline is December 31, 2011.
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subject to subdivision (3), the initial allocation deadline and
subsequent allocation deadlines are automatically extended in
increments of five (5) years, so that allocation deadlines
subsequent to the initial allocation deadline fall on December
31, 2016, and December 31 of each fifth year thereafter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) At least one (1) year before the date of an allocation
deadline determined under subdivision (2), the general
assembly may enact a law that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) terminates the automatic extension of allocation
deadlines under subdivision (2); and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) specifically designates a particular date as the final
allocation deadline.<br>

<b> Distribution and allocation of taxes<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Note: This version of section effective 1-1-2010. See also
preceding version of this section, effective until 1-1-2010.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sec. 39. (a) As used in this section:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Allocation area&quot; means that part of a redevelopment project area
to which an allocation provision of a declaratory resolution adopted
under section 15 of this chapter refers for purposes of distribution
and allocation of property taxes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Base assessed value&quot; means the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If an allocation provision is adopted after June 30, 1995, in
a declaratory resolution or an amendment to a declaratory
resolution establishing an economic development area:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the net assessed value of all the property as finally
determined for the assessment date immediately preceding
the effective date of the allocation provision of the
declaratory resolution, as adjusted under subsection (h); plus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) to the extent that it is not included in clause (A), the net
assessed value of property that is assessed as residential
property under the rules of the department of local
government finance, as finally determined for any
assessment date after the effective date of the allocation
provision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If an allocation provision is adopted after June 30, 1997, in
a declaratory resolution or an amendment to a declaratory
resolution establishing a redevelopment project area:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the net assessed value of all the property as finally
determined for the assessment date immediately preceding
<p>
the effective date of the allocation provision of the
declaratory resolution, as adjusted under subsection (h); plus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) to the extent that it is not included in clause (A), the net
assessed value of property that is assessed as residential
property under the rules of the department of local
government finance, as finally determined for any
assessment date after the effective date of the allocation
provision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) an allocation provision adopted before June 30, 1995, in
a declaratory resolution or an amendment to a declaratory
resolution establishing a redevelopment project area expires
after June 30, 1997; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) after June 30, 1997, a new allocation provision is
included in an amendment to the declaratory resolution;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the net assessed value of all the property as finally determined
for the assessment date immediately preceding the effective
date of the allocation provision adopted after June 30, 1997, as
adjusted under subsection (h).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Except as provided in subdivision (5), for all other
allocation areas, the net assessed value of all the property as
finally determined for the assessment date immediately
preceding the effective date of the allocation provision of the
declaratory resolution, as adjusted under subsection (h).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If an allocation area established in an economic
development area before July 1, 1995, is expanded after June
30, 1995, the definition in subdivision (1) applies to the
expanded part of the area added after June 30, 1995.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) If an allocation area established in a redevelopment project
area before July 1, 1997, is expanded after June 30, 1997, the
definition in subdivision (2) applies to the expanded part of the
area added after June 30, 1997.<br>
Except as provided in section 39.3 of this chapter, &quot;property taxes&quot;
means taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on real property. However, upon
approval by a resolution of the redevelopment commission adopted
before June 1, 1987, &quot;property taxes&quot; also includes taxes imposed
under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on depreciable personal property. If a redevelopment
commission adopted before June 1, 1987, a resolution to include
within the definition of property taxes taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1
on depreciable personal property that has a useful life in excess of
eight (8) years, the commission may by resolution determine the
percentage of taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on all depreciable
personal property that will be included within the definition of
property taxes. However, the percentage included must not exceed
twenty-five percent (25%) of the taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on all
depreciable personal property.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A declaratory resolution adopted under section 15 of this
chapter on or before the allocation deadline determined under
subsection (i) may include a provision with respect to the allocation
and distribution of property taxes for the purposes and in the manner
<p>
provided in this section. A declaratory resolution previously adopted
may include an allocation provision by the amendment of that
declaratory resolution on or before the allocation deadline
determined under subsection (i) in accordance with the procedures
required for its original adoption. A declaratory resolution or an
amendment that establishes an allocation provision after June 30,
1995, must specify an expiration date for the allocation provision.
For an allocation area established before July 1, 2008, the expiration
date may not be more than thirty (30) years after the date on which
the allocation provision is established. For an allocation area
established after June 30, 2008, the expiration date may not be more
than twenty-five (25) years after the date on which the first
obligation was incurred to pay principal and interest on bonds or
lease rentals on leases payable from tax increment revenues.
However, with respect to bonds or other obligations that were issued
before July 1, 2008, if any of the bonds or other obligations that were
scheduled when issued to mature before the specified expiration date
and that are payable only from allocated tax proceeds with respect to
the allocation area remain outstanding as of the expiration date, the
allocation provision does not expire until all of the bonds or other
obligations are no longer outstanding. The allocation provision may
apply to all or part of the redevelopment project area. The allocation
provision must require that any property taxes subsequently levied
by or for the benefit of any public body entitled to a distribution of
property taxes on taxable property in the allocation area be allocated
and distributed as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the proceeds
of the taxes attributable to the lesser of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the assessed value of the property for the assessment
date with respect to which the allocation and distribution is
made; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the base assessed value;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be allocated to and, when collected, paid into the funds of
the respective taxing units.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, property tax
proceeds in excess of those described in subdivision (1) shall be
allocated to the redevelopment district and, when collected,
paid into an allocation fund for that allocation area that may be
used by the redevelopment district only to do one (1) or more of
the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Pay the principal of and interest on any obligations
payable solely from allocated tax proceeds which are
incurred by the redevelopment district for the purpose of
financing or refinancing the redevelopment of that allocation
area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Establish, augment, or restore the debt service reserve
for bonds payable solely or in part from allocated tax
proceeds in that allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Pay the principal of and interest on bonds payable from
allocated tax proceeds in that allocation area and from the
<p>
special tax levied under section 27 of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Pay the principal of and interest on bonds issued by the
unit to pay for local public improvements that are physically
located in or physically connected to that allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E) Pay premiums on the redemption before maturity of
bonds payable solely or in part from allocated tax proceeds
in that allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(F) Make payments on leases payable from allocated tax
proceeds in that allocation area under section 25.2 of this
chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G) Reimburse the unit for expenditures made by it for local
public improvements (which include buildings, parking
facilities, and other items described in section 25.1(a) of this
chapter) that are physically located in or physically
connected to that allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H) Reimburse the unit for rentals paid by it for a building or
parking facility that is physically located in or physically
connected to that allocation area under any lease entered into
under IC&nbsp;36-1-10.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I) For property taxes first due and payable before January
1, 2009, pay all or a part of a property tax replacement credit
to taxpayers in an allocation area as determined by the
redevelopment commission. This credit equals the amount
determined under the following STEPS for each taxpayer in
a taxing district (as defined in IC&nbsp;6-1.1-1-20) that contains
all or part of the allocation area:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP ONE: Determine that part of the sum of the amounts
under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(1)(A), IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(2),
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(3), IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(4), and
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(5) that is attributable to the taxing district.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP TWO: Divide:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that part of each county's eligible property tax
replacement amount (as defined in IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2) for that
year as determined under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-4 that is attributable
to the taxing district; by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the STEP ONE sum.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP THREE: Multiply:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the STEP TWO quotient; times<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the total amount of the taxpayer's taxes (as defined in
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2) levied in the taxing district that have been
allocated during that year to an allocation fund under this
section.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not all the taxpayers in an allocation area receive the credit
in full, each taxpayer in the allocation area is entitled to
receive the same proportion of the credit. A taxpayer may
not receive a credit under this section and a credit under
section 39.5 of this chapter (before its repeal) in the same
year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J) Pay expenses incurred by the redevelopment commission
for local public improvements that are in the allocation area
<p>
or serving the allocation area. Public improvements include
buildings, parking facilities, and other items described in
section 25.1(a) of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(K) Reimburse public and private entities for expenses
incurred in training employees of industrial facilities that are
located:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in the allocation area; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) on a parcel of real property that has been classified as
industrial property under the rules of the department of
local government finance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the total amount of money spent for this purpose
in any year may not exceed the total amount of money in the
allocation fund that is attributable to property taxes paid by
the industrial facilities described in this clause. The
reimbursements under this clause must be made within three
(3) years after the date on which the investments that are the
basis for the increment financing are made.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(L) Pay the costs of carrying out an eligible efficiency
project (as defined in IC&nbsp;36-9-41-1.5) within the unit that
established the redevelopment commission. However,
property tax proceeds may be used under this clause to pay
the costs of carrying out an eligible efficiency project only
if those property tax proceeds exceed the amount necessary
to do the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Make, when due, any payments required under clauses
(A) through (K), including any payments of principal and
interest on bonds and other obligations payable under this
subdivision, any payments of premiums under this
subdivision on the redemption before maturity of bonds,
and any payments on leases payable under this
subdivision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Make any reimbursements required under this
subdivision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Pay any expenses required under this subdivision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Establish, augment, or restore any debt service reserve
under this subdivision.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation fund may not be used for operating expenses of
the commission.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Except as provided in subsection (g), before July 15 of each
year the commission shall do the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Determine the amount, if any, by which the assessed
value of the taxable property in the allocation area for the
most recent assessment date minus the base assessed value,
when multiplied by the estimated tax rate of the allocation
area, will exceed the amount of assessed value needed to
produce the property taxes necessary to make, when due,
principal and interest payments on bonds described in
subdivision (2) plus the amount necessary for other purposes
described in subdivision (2).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Provide a written notice to the county auditor, the fiscal
<p>
body of the county or municipality that established the
department of redevelopment, and the officers who are
authorized to fix budgets, tax rates, and tax levies under
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-17-5 for each of the other taxing units that is wholly
or partly located within the allocation area. The notice must:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) state the amount, if any, of excess assessed value that
the commission has determined may be allocated to the
respective taxing units in the manner prescribed in
subdivision (1); or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) state that the commission has determined that there is
no excess assessed value that may be allocated to the
respective taxing units in the manner prescribed in
subdivision (1).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The county auditor shall allocate to the respective taxing
units the amount, if any, of excess assessed value determined
by the commission. The commission may not authorize an
allocation of assessed value to the respective taxing units
under this subdivision if to do so would endanger the
interests of the holders of bonds described in subdivision (2)
or lessors under section 25.3 of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) For the purpose of allocating taxes levied by or for any taxing
unit or units, the assessed value of taxable property in a territory in
the allocation area that is annexed by any taxing unit after the
effective date of the allocation provision of the declaratory resolution
is the lesser of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the assessed value of the property for the assessment date
with respect to which the allocation and distribution is made; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the base assessed value.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Property tax proceeds allocable to the redevelopment district
under subsection (b)(2) may, subject to subsection (b)(3), be
irrevocably pledged by the redevelopment district for payment as set
forth in subsection (b)(2).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Notwithstanding any other law, each assessor shall, upon
petition of the redevelopment commission, reassess the taxable
property situated upon or in, or added to, the allocation area,
effective on the next assessment date after the petition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Notwithstanding any other law, the assessed value of all
taxable property in the allocation area, for purposes of tax limitation,
property tax replacement, and formulation of the budget, tax rate, and
tax levy for each political subdivision in which the property is
located is the lesser of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the assessed value of the property as valued without regard
to this section; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the base assessed value.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) If any part of the allocation area is located in an enterprise
zone created under IC&nbsp;5-28-15, the unit that designated the allocation
area shall create funds as specified in this subsection. A unit that has
obligations, bonds, or leases payable from allocated tax proceeds
under subsection (b)(2) shall establish an allocation fund for the
purposes specified in subsection (b)(2) and a special zone fund. Such
<p>
a unit shall, until the end of the enterprise zone phase out period,
deposit each year in the special zone fund any amount in the
allocation fund derived from property tax proceeds in excess of those
described in subsection (b)(1) from property located in the enterprise
zone that exceeds the amount sufficient for the purposes specified in
subsection (b)(2) for the year. The amount sufficient for purposes
specified in subsection (b)(2) for the year shall be determined based
on the pro rata portion of such current property tax proceeds from the
part of the enterprise zone that is within the allocation area as
compared to all such current property tax proceeds derived from the
allocation area. A unit that has no obligations, bonds, or leases
payable from allocated tax proceeds under subsection (b)(2) shall
establish a special zone fund and deposit all the property tax
proceeds in excess of those described in subsection (b)(1) in the fund
derived from property tax proceeds in excess of those described in
subsection (b)(1) from property located in the enterprise zone. The
unit that creates the special zone fund shall use the fund (based on
the recommendations of the urban enterprise association) for
programs in job training, job enrichment, and basic skill development
that are designed to benefit residents and employers in the enterprise
zone or other purposes specified in subsection (b)(2), except that
where reference is made in subsection (b)(2) to allocation area it
shall refer for purposes of payments from the special zone fund only
to that part of the allocation area that is also located in the enterprise
zone. Those programs shall reserve at least one-half (1/2) of their
enrollment in any session for residents of the enterprise zone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) The state board of accounts and department of local
government finance shall make the rules and prescribe the forms and
procedures that they consider expedient for the implementation of
this chapter. After each general reassessment under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-4, the
department of local government finance shall adjust the base
assessed value one (1) time to neutralize any effect of the general
reassessment on the property tax proceeds allocated to the
redevelopment district under this section. After each annual
adjustment under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-4-4.5, the department of local government
finance shall adjust the base assessed value one (1) time to neutralize
any effect of the annual adjustment on the property tax proceeds
allocated to the redevelopment district under this section. However,
the adjustments under this subsection may not include the effect of
property tax abatements under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-12.1, and these adjustments
may not produce less property tax proceeds allocable to the
redevelopment district under subsection (b)(2) than would otherwise
have been received if the general reassessment or annual adjustment
had not occurred. The department of local government finance may
prescribe procedures for county and township officials to follow to
assist the department in making the adjustments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The allocation deadline referred to in subsection (b) is
determined in the following manner:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The initial allocation deadline is December 31, 2011.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subject to subdivision (3), the initial allocation deadline and
<p>
subsequent allocation deadlines are automatically extended in
increments of five (5) years, so that allocation deadlines
subsequent to the initial allocation deadline fall on December
31, 2016, and December 31 of each fifth year thereafter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) At least one (1) year before the date of an allocation
deadline determined under subdivision (2), the general
assembly may enact a law that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) terminates the automatic extension of allocation
deadlines under subdivision (2); and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) specifically designates a particular date as the final
allocation deadline.<br>

Sec. 39.2. (a) This section applies to a county having a population
of more than two hundred thousand (200,000) but less than three
hundred thousand (300,000).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As used in this section, &quot;designated taxpayer&quot; means any
taxpayer designated by the commission in a declaratory resolution
adopted or amended under section 15 or 17.5 of this chapter and with
respect to which the commission finds that taxes to be derived from
the taxpayer's depreciable personal property in the allocation area, in
excess of the taxes attributable to the base assessed value of that
personal property, are reasonably expected to exceed in one (1) or
more future years the taxes to be derived from the taxpayer's real
property in the allocation area in excess of the taxes attributable to
the base assessed value of that real property.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The allocation provision of a declaratory resolution may
modify the definition of &quot;property taxes&quot; under section 39(a) of this
chapter to include taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on the depreciable
personal property of designated taxpayers, in accordance with the

this chapter. If such a modification is included in the resolution for
purposes of section 39 of this chapter, the term &quot;base assessed value&quot;
with respect to the depreciable personal property of designated
<p>
taxpayers means the net assessed value of all the depreciable
personal property as finally determined for the assessment date

Sec. 39.3. (a) As used in this section, &quot;depreciable personal
property&quot; refers to:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) all of the designated taxpayer's depreciable personal
property that is located in the allocation area; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) all other depreciable property located and taxable on the
designated taxpayer's site of operations within the allocation
area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As used in this section, &quot;designated taxpayer&quot; means any
taxpayer designated by the commission in a declaratory resolution
adopted or amended under section 15 or 17.5 of this chapter, and
with respect to which the commission finds that taxes to be derived
from the depreciable personal property in the allocation area, in
excess of the taxes attributable to the base assessed value of that
personal property, are needed to pay debt service or to provide
security for bonds issued under section 25.1 of this chapter or to
make payments or to provide security on leases payable under
section 25.2 of this chapter in order to provide local public
improvements for a particular allocation area. However, a
commission may not designate a taxpayer after June 30, 1992, unless
the commission also finds that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the taxpayer's property in the allocation area will consist
primarily of industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, research
and development, processing, distribution, or transportation
related projects; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the taxpayer's property in the allocation area will not consist
primarily of retail, commercial, or residential projects.<br>

modify the definition of &quot;property taxes&quot; under section 39(a) of this
chapter to include taxes imposed under IC&nbsp;6-1.1 on the depreciable
personal property located and taxable on the site of operations of the
designated taxpayers in accordance with the procedures and
limitations set forth in this section and section 39 of this chapter. If
such a modification is included in the resolution, for purposes of
section 39 of this chapter the term &quot;base assessed value&quot; with respect
to the depreciable personal property means the net assessed value of
all the depreciable personal property as finally determined for the

<b> Economic development area; determination; enlargement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 41. (a) The commission may, by following the procedures set
forth in sections 15 through 17 of this chapter, approve a plan for and
determine that a geographic area in the redevelopment district is an
economic development area. Designation of an economic
development area is subject to judicial review in the manner
prescribed in section 18 of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The commission may determine that a geographic area is an
economic development area if it finds that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the plan for the economic development area:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) promotes significant opportunities for the gainful
employment of its citizens;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) attracts a major new business enterprise to the unit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) retains or expands a significant business enterprise
existing in the boundaries of the unit; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) meets other purposes of this section and sections 2.5 and
43 of this chapter;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the plan for the economic development area cannot be
achieved by regulatory processes or by the ordinary operation
of private enterprise without resort to the powers allowed under
this section and sections 2.5 and 43 of this chapter because of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) lack of local public improvement;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) existence of improvements or conditions that lower the
value of the land below that of nearby land;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) multiple ownership of land; or
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) other similar conditions;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the public health and welfare will be benefited by
accomplishment of the plan for the economic development area;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the accomplishment of the plan for the economic
development area will be a public utility and benefit as
measured by:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the attraction or retention of permanent jobs;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) an increase in the property tax base;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) improved diversity of the economic base; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) other similar public benefits; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) the plan for the economic development area conforms to
other development and redevelopment plans for the unit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The determination that a geographic area is an economic
development area must be approved by the unit's legislative body.
The approval may be given either before or after judicial review is
requested. The requirement that the unit's legislative body approve
economic development areas does not prevent the commission from
amending the plan for the economic development area. However, the
enlargement of any boundary in the economic development area must
be approved by the unit's legislative body, and a boundary may not
be enlarged unless:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the existing area does not generate sufficient revenue to
meet the financial obligations of the original project; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the Indiana economic development corporation has, in the
manner provided by section 15(f) of this chapter, made a
finding approving the enlargement of the boundary.<br>

Sec. 47. The commission must make the following findings in the
resolution adopting a housing program under section 45 of this
chapter:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Not more than twenty-five (25) acres of the area included in
the allocation area has been annexed during the preceding five
(5) years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No area within the allocation area has been annexed within
the preceding five (5) years over a remonstrance of a majority
of the owners of land within the annexed area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The program cannot be accomplished by regulatory
processes or by the ordinary operation of private enterprise
because of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the lack of public improvements;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the existence of improvements or conditions that lower

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

Sec. 48. (a) Notwithstanding section 39(a) of this chapter, with
respect to the allocation and distribution of property taxes for the
accomplishment of a program adopted under section 45 of this
chapter, &quot;base assessed value&quot; means the net assessed value of all of
the property, other than personal property, as finally determined for
the assessment date immediately preceding the effective date of the
allocation provision, as adjusted under section 39(h) of this chapter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The allocation fund established under section 39(b) of this
chapter for the allocation area for a program adopted under section
45 of this chapter may be used only for purposes related to the
accomplishment of the program, including the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The construction, rehabilitation, or repair of residential units
within the allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The construction, reconstruction, or repair of any
infrastructure (including streets, sidewalks, and sewers) within
or serving the allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The acquisition of real property and interests in real
property within the allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The demolition of real property within the allocation area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The provision of financial assistance to enable individuals
and families to purchase or lease residential units within the
allocation area. However, financial assistance may be provided
only to those individuals and families whose income is at or
below the county's median income for individuals and families,
respectively.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The provision of financial assistance to neighborhood
development corporations to permit them to provide financial
assistance for the purposes described in subdivision (5).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) For property taxes first due and payable before January 1,
2009, providing each taxpayer in the allocation area a credit for
property tax replacement as determined under subsections (c)
and (d). However, the commission may provide this credit only
if the municipal legislative body (in the case of a redevelopment
commission established by a municipality) or the county
executive (in the case of a redevelopment commission
established by a county) establishes the credit by ordinance
adopted in the year before the year in which the credit is
provided.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The maximum credit that may be provided under subsection
(b)(7) to a taxpayer in a taxing district that contains all or part of an
allocation area established for a program adopted under section 45
of this chapter shall be determined as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP ONE: Determine that part of the sum of the amounts
described in IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(1)(A) and IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(2)
<p>
through IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2(g)(5) (before their repeal) that is
attributable to the taxing district.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP TWO: Divide:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) that part of each county's eligible property tax
replacement amount (as defined in IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2) (before its
repeal) for that year as determined under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-4(a)(1)
(before its repeal) that is attributable to the taxing district; by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the amount determined under STEP ONE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP THREE: Multiply:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) the STEP TWO quotient; by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) the taxpayer's taxes (as defined in IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2) (before
its repeal) levied in the taxing district allocated to the
allocation fund, including the amount that would have been
allocated but for the credit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The commission may determine to grant to taxpayers in an
allocation area from its allocation fund a credit under this section, as
calculated under subsection (c). Except as provided in subsection (g),
one-half (1/2) of the credit shall be applied to each installment of
taxes (as defined in IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2) (before its repeal) that under
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-22-9 are due and payable in a year. The commission must
provide for the credit annually by a resolution and must find in the
resolution the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the money to be collected and deposited in the
allocation fund, based upon historical collection rates, after
granting the credit will equal the amounts payable for
contractual obligations from the fund, plus ten percent (10%) of
those amounts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If bonds payable from the fund are outstanding, that there is
a debt service reserve for the bonds that at least equals the
amount of the credit to be granted.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If bonds of a lessor under section 25.2 of this chapter or
under IC&nbsp;36-1-10 are outstanding and if lease rentals are
payable from the fund, that there is a debt service reserve for
those bonds that at least equals the amount of the credit to be
granted.<br>
If the tax increment is insufficient to grant the credit in full, the
commission may grant the credit in part, prorated among all
taxpayers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Notwithstanding section 39(b) of this chapter, the allocation
fund established under section 39(b) of this chapter for the allocation
area for a program adopted under section 45 of this chapter may only
be used to do one (1) or more of the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Accomplish one (1) or more of the actions set forth in
section 39(b)(2)(A) through 39(b)(2)(H) and 39(b)(2)(J) of this
chapter for property that is residential in nature.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Reimburse the county or municipality for expenditures made
by the county or municipality in order to accomplish the
housing program in that allocation area.<br>
The allocation fund may not be used for operating expenses of the
commission.
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Notwithstanding section 39(b) of this chapter, the commission
shall, relative to the allocation fund established under section 39(b)
of this chapter for an allocation area for a program adopted under
section 45 of this chapter, do the following before July 15 of each
year:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Determine the amount, if any, by which the assessed value
of the taxable property in the allocation area for the most recent
assessment date minus the base assessed value, when multiplied
by the estimated tax rate of the allocation area, will exceed the
amount of assessed value needed to produce the property taxes
necessary:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) to make, when due, principal and interest payments on
bonds described in section 39(b)(2) of this chapter;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) to pay the amount necessary for other purposes
described in section 39(b)(2) of this chapter; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) to reimburse the county or municipality for anticipated
expenditures described in subsection (e)(2).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Provide a written notice to the county auditor, the fiscal
body of the county or municipality that established the
department of redevelopment, and the officers who are
authorized to fix budgets, tax rates, and tax levies under
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-17-5 for each of the other taxing units that is wholly or
partly located within the allocation area. The notice must:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) state the amount, if any, of excess property taxes that the
commission has determined may be paid to the respective
taxing units in the manner prescribed in section 39(b)(1) of
this chapter; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) state that the commission has determined that there is no
excess assessed value that may be allocated to the respective
taxing units in the manner prescribed in subdivision (1).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The county auditor shall allocate to the respective taxing units
the amount, if any, of excess assessed value determined by the
commission.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) This subsection applies to an allocation area only to the extent
that the net assessed value of property that is assessed as residential
property under the rules of the department of local government
finance is not included in the base assessed value. If property tax
installments with respect to a homestead (as defined in
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-12-37) are due in installments established by the department
of local government finance under IC&nbsp;6-1.1-22-9.5, each taxpayer
subject to those installments in an allocation area is entitled to an
additional credit under subsection (d) for the taxes (as defined in
IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2) (before its repeal) due in installments. The credit shall
be applied in the same proportion to each installment of taxes (as
defined in IC&nbsp;6-1.1-21-2) (before its repeal).<br>
