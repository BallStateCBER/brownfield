			I learned of the Brownfield's tool at a workshop provided by the Bowen Center. Union City, as part of our regional economic development group has since filed for a $1M EPA assessment grant. The Brownfields tool is very helpful in the application process. I find it very easy to use and the information helpful in areas other than Brownfields work. Thanks for creating this resource for us!

			I also use it (CBER's Brownfield Grant Writers Tool) when needing details about a county/community for our Board meetings, as a tool to gather specifics in preparation for meetings with potential project funders and for other purposes.  We have four pending grant applications or funding requests for which the Brownfield Grant Writers' Tool was very useful.  Thank you for the effort put into this valuable resource.
